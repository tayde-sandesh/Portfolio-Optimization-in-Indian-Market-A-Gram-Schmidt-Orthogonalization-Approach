Applied Gram-Schmidt Orthonormalization (GSOP) to optimize portfolio risk by converting asset returns into
uncorrelated components, achieving a lower risk of 0.0401 compared to traditional methods.
Identified ideal asset orders that minimized overall volatility and risk up to 0.0386, resulting in a stable and
efficient portfolio.
